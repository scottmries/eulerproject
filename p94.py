# these are called Heronian triangles, and there's a generating function for them:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heronian_triangle

# considering that side lengths must be in the forms
# n, n, n+1 or 
# n, n, n-1

# these must be primitive Heronian triangles, 
# because for all n, gcd(n, n+1) = 1,
# and primitives are defined as gcd(a, b, c) = 1
